📌 Overview

A web-based sorting visualizer built using React that allows users to visually understand how popular sorting algorithms work. The application displays an array of vertical bars, each representing a numerical value, and demonstrates the sorting process through smooth animations and color transitions.

✨ Key Features

Interactive Visualization
Visualizes the Merge Sort algorithm using animated bar movements and dynamic color changes to highlight comparisons and merges.

Dynamic Array Generation
Users can generate new random arrays with varying sizes and values for repeated experimentation.

Sorting Algorithm Implementation
Implements Merge Sort with step-by-step animations, making it ideal for learning and understanding sorting logic.

Customizable Settings

Adjust the number of bars

Control animation speed for better visualization

🧪 How It Works

The application generates a random array of numbers.

Each number is represented as a vertical bar with height proportional to its value.

When sorting is triggered, the Merge Sort algorithm runs.

The sorting process is visualized using:

Color changes to indicate comparisons

Smooth animations to show merging steps

The final sorted array is displayed visually.
